# Session-memory benchmark harness

This directory contains the durable assets behind `wp bench session-memory`.

## Install

No extra install step is required beyond the repo itself. The harness uses the
repo's existing Bun-based runtime and the `wp` CLI surface.

## How to run

1. Choose a workspace mode and export the required environment from
   [`./PREFLIGHT.md`](./PREFLIGHT.md).
2. Validate the harness without making API calls:

   ```bash
   wp bench session-memory --dry-run
   ```

3. Run a single smoke cell:

   ```bash
   wp bench session-memory --scenario debug-long-session --variant baseline --trials 1
   ```

## Expected output

Each run writes `scripts/bench/runs/<run-id>/report.md`.

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `scenario` | Versioned scenario id, for example `debug-long-session` |
| `variant` | `baseline`, `context-mode`, `v1`, or `v2` |
| `trials` | Number of executions per cell |
| `status` | `ok`, `rate_limit`, or `spawn_failed` |
| `cost_usd` | Aggregated USD cost for the cell |
| `recall@5` | Recall score placeholder for scenario qrels |
| `wall_sec` | Mean wall-clock time in seconds |

The CLI also prints a compact JSON summary with `runId`, `dryRun`, `reportPath`,
and `cellCount`.

## Cost cap

The intended smoke budget is a single-cell run:

```bash
wp bench session-memory --scenario debug-long-session --variant baseline --trials 1
```

Use that as the low-risk check before a full matrix run. The blueprint's local
verification gate targets a smoke cost below `$1` for that one-cell path.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| `Missing workspace API keys` | Required env vars are not set | Follow [`./PREFLIGHT.md`](./PREFLIGHT.md) exactly for your workspace mode |
| `Workspace mode unspecified` | `BENCH_WORKSPACE_MODE` is missing | Export `BENCH_WORKSPACE_MODE=isolated` or `BENCH_WORKSPACE_MODE=single-workspace` |
| `rate_limit` in the report | Anthropic throttled the cell | Re-run later or reduce the number of cells/trials |
| `spawn_failed` in the report | `claude` failed before a valid transcript was recorded | Verify local Claude CLI auth and plugin path |
| `Manifest mismatch` | Pinned tool or plugin versions drifted from `manifest.lock.json` | Re-pin deliberately or restore the expected tool/plugin versions |
