# RTK Tool Routing

Fallback-only note: if SessionStart already injected `WP_ROUTING_BLOCK`, or
rtk already injected its own `rtk *` guidance, follow that and do not
duplicate it. This rule exists to preserve the same routing in plain repo
contexts where no injected routing block is present.

Use `rtk *` for shell-tool output filtering on the long-tail command surface
that webpresso and context-mode do not own.

## Ownership boundary

- webpresso owns `wp_*` dev-workflow routing and MCP-shaped deny wording
- context-mode owns `ctx_*` nudging when that plugin is installed
- rtk owns shell-tool output filtering for the long-tail surface (`git`, `gh`,
  `kubectl`, `cargo`, `pytest`, `ruff`, and similar non-quality-engine tools)
- this rule is fallback-only; it should not compete with SessionStart routing
- `.omx` is runtime/state, not a direct hook surface

## Hard rules

- Never reimplement upstream rtk filters in webpresso.
- Never wrap the `rtk` prefix behind `wp rtk`.
- Keep `wp_*`, `ctx_*`, and `rtk *` as independent lanes.

## Lane 4: gstack (interactive/browser workflows)

gstack owns interactive/browser workflows (slash-skill invocation, AskUserQuestion-gated).
This rule is fallback-only; it should not compete with SessionStart routing.
Owned by: ~/.claude/skills/gstack/

## Subprocess coverage note

wp_* tools shelling out via child_process.spawn own their own filtering; rtk PreToolUse hook
only fires for top-level Bash calls and does NOT reach into wp_* internals. CLI verbs
(wp <verb> from a shell) ARE rewritten by rtk.
