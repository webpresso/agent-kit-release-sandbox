# Extraction parity — byte-identity + mutation-score verification

Applies to any blueprint that claims to be a **pure relocation** (moving code
between packages without behaviour changes), including:

- **Fold blueprints** — absorbing one package into another (e.g. folding
  `@webpresso/quality-engine` into `webpresso`).
- **Extraction blueprints** — splitting a module out of a monorepo into a
  standalone public package.
- Any task annotated with "zero behaviour change", "pure move", "rename only",
  or equivalent.

Without an explicit evidence bar, these claims are unverifiable. This rule
establishes the bar.

---

## 1. Byte-identity check (source parity)

Run a recursive diff between the old source tree and its new location
immediately after the relocation lands:

```bash
diff -ru <old-src-dir> <new-src-dir>
```

**Expected result:** empty output, exit code 0.

Any line starting with `+` or `-` (excluding whitespace-only lines) is a
candidate difference. Classify each one before marking the task DONE.

### Acceptable diff categories

The following changes do **not** invalidate a pure-relocation claim, but each
line must be listed in the blueprint task with its category:

| Category | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Import path updates | `@scope/old-package` → `@scope/new-package` |
| Subpath alias changes | `@workspace/utils` → `@webpresso/runtime/utils` |
| Shebang line adjustments | `#!/usr/bin/env node` unchanged; path to bin updated |
| `package.json` name / version fields | `"name": "old"` → `"name": "new"` |

### Unacceptable without explicit justification

If the diff contains any of the following, the task is **not** a pure
relocation and the blueprint must document why the change was intentional:

- Logic changes in production `.ts` / `.js` source files
- Test removal, test weakening, or assertion changes
- Export surface changes (added / removed / renamed exports not already
  documented in the blueprint's API-delta section)
- Dependency additions or removals not driven by a package rename

If you cannot justify a diff line in one sentence, treat it as an unintended
behaviour change and revert it before proceeding.

---

## 2. Mutation-score parity check (test quality)

A relocation that silently drops coverage defeats the purpose of moving code
with its tests. Capture a Stryker baseline before the move and verify the score
is preserved afterward.

```bash
# Step 1 — capture baseline in the old location (before relocation)
pnpm test:mutation 2>&1 | tee /tmp/stryker-old.txt
# Note the final "Mutation score" line, e.g. "Mutation score: 87.50%"

# Step 2 — after relocation, run the same suite in the new location
pnpm test:mutation 2>&1 | tee /tmp/stryker-new.txt
# Note the final "Mutation score" line
```

If the repo uses a JSON reporter instead:

```bash
vp exec vitest run --config vitest.stryker.config.ts --reporter=json \
  > /tmp/stryker-old.json   # before
vp exec vitest run --config vitest.stryker.config.ts --reporter=json \
  > /tmp/stryker-new.json   # after
```

**Acceptance threshold:** new score ≥ old score − 2 (two-point tolerance
accounts for statistical variance in survivor sampling).

A drop larger than two points signals that tests were lost or weakened during
the move. Investigate and restore coverage before marking the task DONE.

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria template

A blueprint task that claims parity DONE must cite all three items:

```markdown
**Parity evidence:**
- `diff -ru <old-src-dir> <new-src-dir>` output:
  - [ ] Empty (full pass), OR
  - [ ] Non-empty — listed below with category justification:
    - `<diff line>` — acceptable: import path update (`@old` → `@new`)
- Mutation score: **before XX.XX% → after YY.YY%** (Δ = Z pts)
  - [ ] New score ≥ old score − 2 ✓
- Any unacceptable diff lines addressed:
  - [ ] None found, OR  [ ] <line> — reverted / justified: <reason>
```

---

## 4. How to apply in a blueprint

Add a dedicated task to the blueprint that runs these checks after the
file-move task completes:

```markdown
#### Task N.M: Verify byte-identity and mutation-score parity
- [ ] Run `diff -ru <old-src-dir> <new-src-dir>` — output must be empty or
      contain only acceptable-category lines (see `extraction-parity` rule).
- [ ] Capture mutation score before relocation; confirm new score ≥ old − 2.
- [ ] List every non-empty diff line with its category justification in this
      task. Unacceptable lines must be reverted before this task closes.
- [ ] Paste parity evidence block (template from `extraction-parity` rule).
```

Reference in the blueprint overview:

```markdown
**Verification standard:** byte-identity + mutation-score parity
(see `catalog/agent/rules/extraction-parity.md`).
```

---

## Why this rule exists

Task 1.4 of the `fold-webpresso-quality-engine-into-webpresso`
blueprint first applied this pattern. Without it, "pure relocation" was an
unchecked claim — the diff step caught an import-path inconsistency that would
otherwise have shipped silently. Codifying the bar here means future fold and
extraction blueprints inherit it rather than re-derive it.

The two-point mutation-score tolerance is intentional: Stryker sampling is
non-deterministic across runs; a tolerance tighter than two points produces
false negatives on large suites.
