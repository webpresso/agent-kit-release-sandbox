# Plan Refine (`/plan-refine`)

Refine a blueprint by applying the canonical plan-refine methodology to the actual file, not just reviewing it.

**Arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Usage

```bash
/plan-refine <slug>
/plan-refine customer-runtime-zero-legacy-confidence
```

## What This Command Does

Edits `blueprints/*/<slug>/_overview.md` so the blueprint is:

- fact-checked against current docs and repo reality
- aligned with planning and testing rules
- structured for parallel execution via `/pll`
- explicit about risks, edge cases, and cross-plan dependencies

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Locate the blueprint

```bash
find blueprints -name "_overview.md" -path "*/$SLUG/*"
```

If no matching blueprint exists, stop and report that.

### Step 2: Load the canonical methodology

Read [plan-refine](/.agent/skills/plan-refine/SKILL.md) and use it as the source of truth for refinement criteria.

### Step 3: Refine the blueprint end to end

Apply the methodology directly to the blueprint:

1. Technology fact-check
   - verify library, API, runtime, and platform claims against current official docs
   - replace vague or unverified claims with evidence-backed wording
2. Codebase verification
   - confirm file paths, package boundaries, exports, and API signatures against the repo
   - correct assumptions that do not match current code
3. Architecture review
   - add or tighten handling for concurrency, retries, error cascades, auth/session edges, and platform limits
4. Cross-plan alignment
   - verify referenced blueprints still exist and still support the stated dependency contract
5. Blueprint enforcement
   - split coarse tasks
   - add explicit dependencies
   - ensure TDD steps, exact files, exact commands, and verification steps are present
   - use t-shirt sizing only
   - prefer the repo's preferred database workflow (e.g. `db push` over migrations) when the repo has chosen one

### Step 4: Apply edits, do not stop at findings

Update the blueprint file directly instead of only producing a report.

Expected edits commonly include:

- rewriting tasks into smaller blueprint-format units
- fixing stale paths or APIs
- adding missing edge cases and risks
- tightening acceptance criteria
- adding cross-plan reference corrections
- replacing speculative language with verified statements

### Step 5: Validate the refined artifact

Run the blueprint parser check:

```bash
wp blueprint show <slug>
```

If the refinement changes markdown structure enough to warrant a lint pass, also run your repo's markdown linter against `blueprints/*/<slug>/_overview.md` (for example, `just lint-md` with webpresso's just recipes).

### Step 6: Report the outcome

Summarize:

- what changed in the blueprint
- what claims were corrected
- what risks or unknowns still remain
- whether any notable risks or unknowns still need a separate manual review

## Guardrails

- Do not invent supporting code that does not exist.
- Do not preserve stale technology claims for compatibility.
- Do not leave large, multi-file, ambiguous tasks when they can be split.
- Prefer primary sources for fact-checking.
- Keep the refined plan executable by the next agent without extra interpretation.
