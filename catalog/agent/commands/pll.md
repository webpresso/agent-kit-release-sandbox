# /pll - Blueprint-Aware Parallel Execution

Execute Blueprint-shaped work through the current parallel engine layer while keeping durable lifecycle state on the shipped `wp blueprint` surface.

`/pll` is an **operator adapter**, not a standalone runtime. It is the interactive half of the same shared execution model used by `wp blueprint exec`, so both surfaces should agree on launch spec shape, backend vocabulary, and runtime-state bridge semantics.

It does three things:

1. understands task dependencies well enough to preserve ordering
2. keeps Blueprint lifecycle state honest via `wp blueprint start|task|finalize`
3. delegates generic parallel fan-out to the active engine layer (`$ultrawork`, subagents, or equivalent host-native parallel lanes)

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

## Input Formats

### Format 1: Numbered list with optional dependencies

```text
1. Fix lint errors in packages/auth
2. Fix lint errors in packages/utils
3. Fix typecheck errors in packages/auth [depends: 1]
4. Fix typecheck errors in packages/utils [depends: 2]
5. Run tests for packages/auth [depends: 3]
6. Run tests for packages/utils [depends: 4]
```

### Format 2: Simple comma-separated list

```text
/pll "fix auth lint, fix utils lint, update docs"
```

### Format 3: File path

```text
/pll tasks.md
/pll blueprints/in-progress/my-blueprint/_overview.md
```

### Format 4: Conversation context

```text
/pll
```

If invoked without arguments, infer the nearest task list from the latest user context. If that context is anchored to a blueprint, apply Blueprint lifecycle rules.

## Blueprint Lifecycle Rules

When `/pll` is executing blueprint-backed work:

- use `wp blueprint start <slug>` before execution begins
- use `wp blueprint task start <slug> <taskId>` when a task starts
- use `wp blueprint task block <slug> <taskId> --reason "<reason>"` when work is blocked
- use `wp blueprint task complete <slug> <taskId>` only after the task's acceptance and verification actually pass
- use `wp blueprint finalize <slug>` only after all tasks are validly done
- do **not** use `wp blueprint move` as the normal execution primitive; it is recovery-only


## Roadmap-Aware Lane Picking

When invoked without an explicit task list, `/pll` should prefer the roadmap-shaped queue exposed by `wp blueprint list`:

1. Read `wp blueprint list` first. `ROADMAP` rows are strategic parents; indented `CHILD` rows are tactical lanes.
2. Choose the next `planned` child under an active (`in-progress` or `planned`) roadmap, respecting each child's `depends_on:` before fan-out.
3. Use orphan blueprints only when no roadmap child is actionable. The `ORPHANS` group is fallback work, not the primary lane queue.
4. Keep output-shape assumptions aligned with `ROADMAP ... children=N ...`, `CHILD ... parent=<roadmap>`, and `ORPHANS` rows from `wp blueprint list`.
5. If the roadmap/child relationship looks inconsistent, run `wp audit roadmap-links` before dispatching lanes.

## What `/pll` Owns

- parsing lightweight dependency hints from task lists or blueprint task structure
- prioritizing ready work using dependency order, critical-path pressure, and practical file-scope judgment
- choosing a safe level of parallelism for the current runtime
- keeping lifecycle state synchronized with actual execution
- reporting progress, blockers, and verification outcomes

## Shared Execution Model

`/pll` and `wp blueprint exec` are two surfaces over one repo-owned model:

- same Blueprint-backed launch spec
- same backend names and policy hooks
- same runtime-state bridge
- same truthfulness rules for `start`, `task`, `block`, `complete`, `finalize`, `status`, `resume`, and `stop`

If the model would diverge between the two surfaces, fix the contract instead of creating a `/pll`-only exception.

## What `/pll` Does **NOT** Own

- durable plan storage
- standalone runner/runtime semantics
- a guaranteed fixed number of active agents at all times
- host-specific background-task APIs or polling contracts
- replacing `$ultrawork` as the generic engine layer

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Parse and Ground

1. Parse the input into discrete tasks and dependency hints.
2. If the source is a blueprint, read the blueprint task list and lifecycle state first.
3. Reject obvious cycles or contradictory dependency declarations before execution begins.
4. Produce a compact `/pll DAG Analysis` summary:

```text
/pll DAG Analysis
  Total: 8 tasks
  Ready now: 3
  Critical path: Task 1.1 -> Task 2.1 -> Task 4.1
  Suggested max parallelism: 3
```

### Phase 2: Delegate Through the Engine Layer

1. Start with ready tasks only.
2. Prioritize work that unblocks the longest chain or the most downstream tasks.
3. Delegate independent work through the current engine layer:
   - prefer `$ultrawork` / host-native subagents for true independent lanes
   - keep test-heavy or build-heavy work at lower concurrency when needed
4. Update Blueprint task state before and after execution so the durable artifact stays truthful.
5. If a task fails, block it with a concrete reason and leave downstream work blocked unless explicitly safe to continue.

### Phase 3: Verify and Report

1. Run the task-level verification named by the task or blueprint.
2. Run repo-level verification when the change scope justifies it.
3. Report:
   - completed tasks
   - blocked tasks with reasons
   - remaining ready tasks
   - verification evidence

## Concurrency Guidance

| Scope | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Use only as much parallelism as the current runtime and task mix safely support |
| Test-heavy work | Reduce parallelism to avoid exhausting Vitest/CPU/memory |
| Build-heavy work | Reduce parallelism to avoid CPU/memory spikes |
| Mixed doc + code work | Run lightweight doc/admin work beside one heavier lane when safe |

## Failure Handling

| Event | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Task fails | Mark blocked with reason; do not mark complete |
| Lifecycle mutation fails | Stop immediately rather than continuing with stale plan state |
| Dependency cycle detected | Reject the run and ask for plan cleanup |
| No ready tasks remain | Report blockers and the tasks they are waiting on |
| File-scope conflict suspected | Serialize the conflicting tasks or merge them into one lane |

## Examples

```text
/pll "lint auth, lint utils, typecheck auth [depends: 1], test auth [depends: 3]"

/pll blueprints/in-progress/converge-omx-and-blueprint-planning-surfaces/_overview.md

/pll
```

## Verification Discipline

- Prefer per-file or per-package verification first.
- Use `wp blueprint audit` and the task's named checks to prove state transitions.
- Never treat orchestration progress as proof of correctness.
