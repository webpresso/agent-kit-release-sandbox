# /audit-duplication

Run duplication analysis using jscpd and provide recommendations.

## Steps

1. Execute `just analysis-duplication` (or your repo's equivalent runner) to run jscpd
2. Parse the console output or JSON report
3. Identify top duplication clusters
4. Provide specific recommendations for each cluster

## Output Format

- Summary of total duplication percentage
- Top 5 duplication clusters with file locations
- Specific recommendations for remediation
- Suggested canonical packages for shared code

## Example Usage

```bash
/audit-duplication
```

## Implementation Notes

- Uses jscpd (JavaScript Code Plagiarism Detector)
- Minimum 10 lines and 50 tokens for detection
- Reports both syntactic and semantic duplicates
- Suggests extraction to your repo's shared utility or types packages
