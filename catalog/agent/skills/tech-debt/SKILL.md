# tech-debt

Manage the tech-debt lifecycle using `wp tech-debt` commands.

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new tech-debt item (written to webpresso/tech-debt/<status>/h-NNN-<kebab-title>.md)
wp tech-debt new "Legacy CLI complexity" \
  --severity medium \
  --category complexity \
  --review-cadence quarterly \
  --status accepted

# Preview without writing
wp tech-debt new "Performance bottleneck" --severity high --category mutation --dry-run

# List all tech-debt items (optional filters)
wp tech-debt list
wp tech-debt list --status accepted
wp tech-debt list --status needs-remediation --severity high
wp tech-debt list --category security

# Review: show items past their review date (exits non-zero if any are overdue)
wp tech-debt review

# Audit tech-debt files against the schema (CI gate)
wp audit tech-debt --root .
```

## File naming

Files are named `h-NNN-<kebab-title>.md` where `NNN` is auto-incremented across all status directories.

## Status lifecycle

```
accepted → needs-remediation → monitoring → resolved
```
