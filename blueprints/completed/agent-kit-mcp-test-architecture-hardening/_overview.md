## Product wedge anchor

- **Stage outcome:** MCP blueprint-server verification is deterministic and bounded by file-level Vitest parallelism.
- **Consuming surface:** `wp_test` / `wp_qa` verification for `src/mcp/blueprint-server*.test.ts`.
- **New user-visible capability:** Contributors can verify blueprint MCP contracts quickly without raising timeouts or weakening stale-read behavior.

## Summary

Harden the MCP blueprint-server test architecture by splitting monolithic coverage, sharing setup helpers, preserving missing-vs-stale projection contracts, removing timestamp-order flakes in promote tests, and extending the same deterministic contract to blueprint project discovery so slow roots/git scans degrade with warnings instead of hanging the tool call.

## Verification-performance contract

- Do **not** raise Vitest or handler timeouts to hide slow tests.
- Do **not** loosen global Vitest isolation defaults.
- Do **not** silently repair stale projections on read paths; stale list/get/context reads must return `next_action.kind: "reingest_project"`.
- Lazy projection creation is allowed only for missing DBs.
- Steady-state target: targeted blueprint-server verification should pass under a 45s wrapper cap; `<30s` remains the stretch regression target.

## Findings

- **F1 — CRITICAL:** The original blueprint-server suite was structurally too monolithic for Vitest’s default worker model.
- **F2 — HIGH:** `test.concurrent` alone is not a replacement for file splitting because it stays inside one worker.
- **F3 — HIGH:** Promote-path validation tests depended on same-ms filesystem timestamp ordering.
- **F4 — HIGH:** Missing projection DB and stale projection DB behavior must remain distinct.
- **F5 — MEDIUM:** Shared temp-repo/tool-registration/result parsing setup was duplicated across MCP test files.
- **F6 — MEDIUM:** The timeout problem is local to MCP/blueprint verification architecture; no global isolation policy change is needed.
- **F7 — HIGH:** In-test wall-clock assertions are deterministic flake sources under Vitest worker contention; timing should be measured by bounded `wp_test` batches, not by `Date.now()` assertions inside contract tests.
- **F8 — CRITICAL:** `wp_blueprint_projects` / aggregate blueprint discovery still lacks an explicit guard around roots fetches and top-level discovery, so a slow dependency can consume the full transport timeout.
- **F9 — HIGH:** Git-backed project discovery currently uses unbounded subprocess calls; a slow `git worktree list` / `rev-parse` path can stall otherwise healthy MCP reads.
- **F10 — HIGH:** Discovery timeout handling must degrade to partial structured results + warnings; transport-level hangs are not an acceptable user contract.

## Implementation notes

- Added `src/mcp/blueprint-server.test-harness.ts` for registrar/tool invocation, temp repo creation, fixture writing, lazy/no-projection setup, projection-backed setup, explicit validation timestamp seeding, and stale metadata seeding.
- Added `src/mcp/blueprint-server.test-architecture.test.ts` as an automated regression guard for split files, serial-size budgets, no `test.concurrent`, no old 120s timeout literals, and no production imports of the test harness.
- Split read/projection coverage into:
  - `src/mcp/blueprint-server.list-projection.test.ts`
  - `src/mcp/blueprint-server.get-projection.test.ts`
  - `src/mcp/blueprint-server.context-projection.test.ts`
- Split verify/idempotency coverage into `src/mcp/blueprint-server.verify-idempotency.test.ts`.
- Split platform-first mutation/read coverage into:
  - `src/mcp/blueprint-server.platform-first.task-advance.test.ts`
  - `src/mcp/blueprint-server.platform-first.lifecycle.test.ts`
  - `src/mcp/blueprint-server.platform-first.scaffold-read.test.ts`
- Added `src/mcp/blueprint-server.platform-first.test-harness.ts` so platform adapter wiring and fixture setup stay consistent across those files.
- Moved duplicated timeout guard assertions to `src/mcp/blueprint-server.platform-timeouts.test.ts`.
- Made promote tests deterministic by writing an explicit future validation timestamp after validation setup.
- Aligned adjacent registration/workflow tests with the hardened projection contract: registration is lightweight and never repairs projections; stale aggregate projects report `next_action.kind: "reingest_project"`; missing projection DBs may lazy-create.
- Removed brittle wall-clock assertions from MCP workflow/fixture tests and the blueprint DB migration bulk-insert test; those tests now assert behavior, while performance is guarded by external `wp_test` timing evidence.
- Added an empty-projection test harness for read-only empty-DB assertions so tests that do not exercise lazy missing-DB repair no longer pay per-test cold-start ingestion.
- Promoted get/context/list read-only base harnesses, platform timeout fixtures, verify empty-DB setup, and platform task-next read fixtures to suite-scoped or pre-projected setup while preserving per-test adapter/env reset and per-test isolation for mutating scenarios.
- Hardened the architecture guard so read-only projection suites cannot reintroduce `makeLazyBlueprintHarness` inside `beforeEach`; the guard includes an old-pattern fixture assertion proving the detector catches the regression.
- Follow-up lane approved: discovery-path hardening will reuse the same “bounded external boundary + deterministic degradation” contract rather than inventing a looser timeout policy for `wp_blueprint_projects` / `wp_blueprint_list`.

## Cross-plan references

| Blueprint | Relationship | Required alignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blueprints/draft/codex-global-hook-runtime-hardening/_overview.md` | Sibling runtime-hardening child | Shares the same no-timeout-as-fix and deterministic-boundary rules; hook runtime and blueprint MCP discovery must converge on bounded, path-stable behavior. |

## Quick Reference (Remaining Execution Waves)

| Wave | Tasks | Dependencies | Parallelizable | Effort (T-shirt) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Wave 0** | 6.1, 6.2 | None | 2 agents | XS-S |
| **Wave 1** | 6.3 | 6.1, 6.2 | 1 agent | S |
| **Critical path** | 6.1 → 6.3 | — | 2 waves | S |

### Parallel Metrics Snapshot (Remaining Work)

| Metric | Formula / Meaning | Target | Actual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RW0 | Ready tasks in Wave 0 | ≥ 2 | 2 |
| CPR | total_tasks / critical_path_length | ≥ 2.5 | 3 / 2 = 1.5 |
| DD | dependency_edges / total_tasks | ≤ 2.0 | 2 / 3 = 0.67 |
| CP | same-file overlaps per wave | 0 | 0 |

Refinement delta: this lane stays intentionally narrow because the remaining work is a bounded hardening pass over shared discovery code, not a fresh multi-surface feature build.

- Guard hardening: architecture test now forbids in-test wall-clock assertion patterns across `blueprint-server*.test.ts`, preventing flaky local-budget reintroduction.
- Stabilization baseline: the same 10-file target initially hit the unchanged 45s cap with repeated empty-projection cold starts still visible in output; this confirmed setup churn, not assertion behavior, was the remaining risk.

#### [mcp-core] Task 6.1: Bound blueprint roots fetch and top-level discovery

**Status:** done

**Verification:**

```webpresso-evidence-v1
[{"command":"pnpm exec vitest run src/mcp/blueprint-server.projects.timeouts.test.ts src/blueprint/projects.test.ts src/mcp/blueprint-server.project-resolver.test.ts","exit_code":0,"kind":"test","result":"pass","ts":"2026-05-28T13:00:58.000Z"}]
```

**Depends:** None

Add explicit timeout guards around the `registerBlueprintServer()` roots cache
fetch and `handleProjects()` / aggregate discovery entrypoints so slow external
dependencies return bounded structured warnings instead of consuming the full
transport timeout. Preserve backward-compatible payload shape; add warnings and
`next_action` only.

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/mcp/blueprint-server.ts`
- Modify: `src/mcp/blueprint-server.projects.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/mcp/blueprint-server.project-resolver.test.ts`

**Acceptance:**

- [x] Slow roots/discovery paths return within a fixed local budget
- [x] Tool output degrades to partial results + warnings, not transport timeout
- [x] Existing successful read paths keep their current structured output contract
#### [projects-core] Task 6.2: Bound git-backed project discovery subprocesses

**Status:** done

**Verification:**

```webpresso-evidence-v1
[{"command":"pnpm exec vitest run src/blueprint/projects.test.ts","exit_code":0,"kind":"test","result":"pass","ts":"2026-05-28T13:00:58.000Z"}]
```

**Depends:** None

Add explicit subprocess deadlines to git-backed discovery helpers in
`src/blueprint/projects.ts` and treat deadline expiry as a soft failure for the
offending repo/worktree contribution. Keep recursive scan caps unchanged; the
hardening target is roots/git, not scan breadth inflation.

**Files:**

- Modify: `src/blueprint/projects.ts`
- Modify: `src/blueprint/projects.test.ts`

**Acceptance:**

- [x] Git probes cannot block discovery indefinitely
- [x] Timeout/slow-git paths are covered by deterministic tests
- [x] Successful worktree discovery behavior remains intact under normal timing
#### [docs/qa] Task 6.3: Codify discovery hard decisions and prove the bounded contract

**Status:** done

**Verification:**

```webpresso-evidence-v1
[{"command":"pnpm exec vitest run src/mcp/blueprint-server.projects.timeouts.test.ts src/blueprint/projects.test.ts src/mcp/blueprint-server.project-resolver.test.ts src/mcp/blueprint-server.projects.workspace-targeting.test.ts src/mcp/blueprint-server.projects.aggregate-scope.test.ts","exit_code":0,"kind":"test","result":"pass","ts":"2026-05-28T13:02:12.000Z"}]
```

**Depends:** Task 6.1, Task 6.2

After the code-path hardening lands, update durable repo instructions so future
work cannot regress by “fixing” discovery hangs with bigger timeouts. Then run
the narrowest targeted verification proving the old hang path now returns
bounded structured output.

**Files:**

- Modify: `.agent/rules/no-timeout-as-fix.md`
- Modify: `.agent/rules/agent-guide.md`
- Modify: `AGENTS.md`

**Acceptance:**

- [x] Repo instructions explicitly forbid timeout inflation for discovery hangs
- [x] Repo instructions require bounded degradation for hook/discovery runtimes
- [x] Targeted MCP tests document the new bounded contract with evidence
