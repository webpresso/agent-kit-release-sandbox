## Product wedge anchor

- **Stage outcome:** `@webpresso/agent-kit` releases through a standard Changesets Action flow on GitHub Actions, with explicit public npm access, provenance, and marketplace compatibility behavior.
- **Consuming surface:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.changeset/config.json`, `package.json`, release docs/tests, and marketplace compatibility consumers of `release/v<version>`.
- **New user-visible capability:** maintainers can merge a version PR and let GitHub Actions publish the package safely without ad hoc local release commands.

## Summary

Migrate the repo from the current custom direct-publish release workflow to a Changesets Action-driven release model. Keep the important existing contracts explicit:

- `pnpm run version` remains the single versioning path and must preserve marketplace version sync
- `v<version>` tags the published version-bump commit on `main`
- `release/v<version>` remains a separate compatibility branch carrying the `dist/` commit for marketplace consumers
- GitHub Releases are **not** auto-created in the initial rollout
- production cutover is blocked until a sandbox trusted-publishing rehearsal proves the exact OIDC/tag/branch/no-release behavior

This blueprint explicitly accepts the loss of the current “publish succeeds before `main` is version-bumped” invariant as part of the migration, but only with guardrails and rollback handling documented up front.

## Evidence-grounded repo facts

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` is currently a custom worktree-based direct-publish flow.
- `.changeset/config.json` currently sets `"access": "restricted"`.
- `package.json` currently sets `publishConfig.access` to `public` and keeps `scripts.version = "changeset version && vp run sync-marketplace-version"`.
- `scripts/sync-marketplace-version.ts` is the marketplace manifest sync mechanism.
- `scripts/release.ts` and `scripts/release.test.ts` currently model `release/v<version>` dist-branch behavior.
- `src/build/auth-preflight-packages.test.ts`, `src/build/validate-marketplace.test.ts`, and `package.contract.test.ts` are concrete release-contract tests.
- `catalog/AGENTS.md.tpl` is the editable source of truth; `AGENTS.md` is generated/managed output.

## Key decisions

- **Release driver:** use `changesets/action` as the orchestrator.
- **Publish path:** use `pnpm run release:publish`, which must call `npm publish --provenance --access public`.
- **Access contract:** `.changeset/config.json` and `package.json#publishConfig.access` must both say `public`.
- **Tag semantics:** `v<version>` tags the published version-bump commit on `main`.
- **Compatibility branch:** `release/v<version>` is a separate branch for the dist-carrying marketplace commit.
- **GitHub Release object:** disabled initially.
- **Trusted-publishing gate:** sandbox proof first, production cutover second.

## Cross-plan references

- `blueprints/in-progress/agent-kit-public-npm-cutover-implementation/_overview.md` — public npm/package-surface hardening already done; this migration must preserve those contracts.
- `.omx/plans/ralplan-dr-agent-kit-changesets-action-release-flow-20260528.md` — consensus planning artifact for this migration.

## Technology choices

| Area | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release orchestrator | `changesets/action@v1` | Standardizes the PR + publish flow while keeping explicit repo-owned hooks for non-default behavior. |
| Version step | `pnpm run version` | Preserves the existing `changeset version && vp run sync-marketplace-version` contract so marketplace metadata stays aligned. |
| Publish step | `pnpm run release:publish` → `npm publish --provenance --access public` | Keeps the public-access contract explicit and provenance-ready. |
| Auth model | npm trusted publishing / OIDC first | Eliminates long-lived publish-token dependence after rehearsal proof. |
| Marketplace compatibility | retain `release/v<version>` branch initially | Preserves the dist-carrying consumer path during the migration. |
| GitHub Releases | disabled initially | Avoids adding another public contract surface until the new workflow is proven. |

## Risks

| ID | Severity | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | High | Version PR merges but publish fails, leaving `main` ahead of the registry | Explicitly accept the atomicity tradeoff, add rollback procedure, and gate completion on successful publish or clean revert. |
| R2 | High | Marketplace version drift breaks plugin consumers | Keep `pnpm run version` canonical and require `src/build/validate-marketplace.test.ts` in the release gate. |
| R3 | High | Trusted publishing works in sandbox but fails in prod | Require sandbox OIDC proof with exact evidence before production cutover. |
| R4 | Medium | Tag/branch semantics drift and downstream consumers pin the wrong artifact | Lock `v<version>` on the mainline version-bump commit and `release/v<version>` on the dist compatibility branch. |
| R5 | Medium | Generated release docs drift from source templates | Treat `catalog/AGENTS.md.tpl` as source of truth and require `wp sync --check`. |

## Quick Reference (Execution Waves)

| Wave | Tasks | Dependencies | Parallelizable | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Wave 0** | 1.1, 1.2 | None / 1.1 partial | 2 lanes | S-M |
| **Wave 1** | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 | Wave 0 | 3 lanes | S-M |
| **Wave 2** | 3.1, 3.2 | Wave 1 / 3.1 | 1-2 lanes | M |
| **Critical path** | 1.1 → 1.2 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 3.1 → 3.2 | — | 6 steps | L |

### Parallel Metrics Snapshot

| Metric | Formula / Meaning | Target | Actual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RW0 | Ready tasks in Wave 0 | ≥ 2 | 2 |
| CPR | total_tasks / critical_path_length | ≥ 2.5 | 6 / 6 = 1.0 |
| DD | dependency_edges / total_tasks | ≤ 2.0 | 5 / 6 = 0.83 |
| CP | same-file overlaps per wave | 0 | 0 |

Refinement delta:
- This plan is intentionally **not highly parallel** because the release contract surfaces (`release.yml`, `.changeset/config.json`, `package.json`) are tightly coupled and high-risk. We optimize for correctness over width.

## Pre-mortem + rollback matrix

| Scenario | Detector | Blast radius | Operator action | Stop/go rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Version PR merged but publish fails | `changesets/action` publish step fails; `npm view <pkg>@<version>` missing | `main` has bumped version/changelog/marketplace, registry does not | fix publish root cause and rerun safely, or revert merged version PR before tags/branches | **STOP** until published or cleanly reverted |
| Publish succeeds but tag fails | npm version exists; `git rev-parse v<version>^{commit}` fails | registry state ahead of source-of-truth tag | create/verify tag from published version-bump commit on `main` | **STOP** until tag proof passes |
| Tag succeeds but `release/v<version>` push fails | tag exists; remote branch missing | marketplace/dist-branch consumers break | recreate/push compatibility branch and rerun consumer smoke | **STOP** until branch and smoke pass |
| Rerun on already-published version | publish logs match already-published path | risk of duplicate artifact churn only | treat publish as idempotent success; verify tag + branch state only | **GO** only if artifact proofs pass |
| Sandbox OIDC works but prod OIDC fails | sandbox proof passes, prod auth fails | prod cutover blocked | verify trusted-publisher binding, repo/env mapping, fallback policy | **STOP** prod cutover |
| `wp sync --check` or generated docs drift after versioning | sync/doc checks fail after versioning | release guidance diverges from source of truth | regenerate from source, recommit, rerun checks | **STOP** until clean |

- Modify or replace: `scripts/release.test.ts`

**Steps (TDD):**
1. Encode that `v<version>` tags the published version-bump commit on `main`.
2. Encode that `release/v<version>` is a separate compatibility branch carrying the dist commit.
3. Explicitly disable auto-created GitHub Release objects in the initial rollout.
4. Make the rerun/already-published path preserve those semantics.

**Acceptance:**
