# Hook Coordination Across RTK, context-mode, and agent-kit — Fact-Check and SoA

> **TL;DR.** Three of the four moves I proposed in the prior turn do not survive contact with the verified Anthropic hooks spec, the repo's lane-ownership rule in [`catalog/agent/rules/gstack-routing.md`](../../catalog/agent/rules/gstack-routing.md), and the current audit blueprint at [`blueprints/draft/ak-audit-hook-surface-single-rewriter-per-matcher-invariant-ci-gate`](../../blueprints/draft/ak-audit-hook-surface-single-rewriter-per-matcher-invariant-ci-gate/_overview.md). The right move is to enforce the single-rewriter invariant and keep ownership lanes separate, not invent a parallel coordination scheme.

## What the current repo guidance already mandates

[`blueprints/draft/ak-audit-hook-surface-single-rewriter-per-matcher-invariant-ci-gate/_overview.md`](../../blueprints/draft/ak-audit-hook-surface-single-rewriter-per-matcher-invariant-ci-gate/_overview.md) (status: `draft`) names the immediate goal as:

> *"Add `wp audit hook-surface` to enforce the Anthropic-documented single-rewriter-per-matcher invariant for Claude Code hooks."*

Combined with the lane model in [`catalog/agent/rules/gstack-routing.md`](../../catalog/agent/rules/gstack-routing.md), the current repo shape is:

```text
Claude Code
  ├─ official path: plugin + settings.json hooks
  ├─ agent-kit owns repo-local wp_* hook entrypoints
  ├─ context-mode owns ctx_* routing guidance when installed
  └─ rtk owns shell filtering lane where documented

Codex
  ├─ repo layer: .codex/hooks.json for agent-kit/OMX-managed local hooks
  ├─ user layer: user-level Codex hooks for context-mode/Codex-native hooks
  ├─ expected composition: multiple owners may share an event
  └─ drift condition: same owner/command duplicated without an explicit exception

OpenCode
  └─ context-mode owns plugin-based routing/compaction support
```

The **key design conclusion** — and the one that invalidates half of my prior advice — is the combination of those two repo truths:

1. ownership stays split by lane (`wp_*`, `ctx_*`, `rtk`, gstack/browser flows), and
2. Anthropic's hook model only gives you a safe system when one matcher has one rewriter.

In plain words: **shared events are normal; overlapping rewriters are the bug.**

## Fact-check of my four prior claims

### Claim 1: "Pin a sequential hook order"

**Verdict: WRONG.**

The Anthropic spec explicitly says hooks run in parallel and there is no priority field. The guidance is structural: *"Avoid having more than one hook modify the same tool's input."* You cannot configure your way out of the race — you have to ensure only one rewriter exists per matcher.

In the actual installed state on this workspace:

- the user-level Claude settings register `rtk hook claude` for the
  PreToolUse `Bash` matcher.
- the installed context-mode plugin hook rewrites Bash → `ctx_execute`.
- this repo's `.claude/settings.json` registers `wp-pretool-guard` for
  PreToolUse `Bash|Write|Edit|MultiEdit`.

`wp-pretool-guard` is a **validator** (verified: `src/hooks/pretool-guard/validators/*` — `forbidden-commands.test.ts`, `dangerous-commands.ts`, `mcp-redirect.ts`, `package-imports.ts`, `plan-frontmatter.ts`, `test-quality.ts`). It does not call `updatedInput`. So the actual race is **only** between RTK and context-mode.

The structural fix is *"only one rewriter per matcher"*: have context-mode itself detect RTK and either (a) skip its own rewrite when RTK is installed, or (b) compose them — see Claim 2.

### Claim 2: "Chain RTK inside `ctx_execute`"

**Verdict: VALID but requires confirmation against the repo's ownership guidance.**

Verified mechanism: RTK's `rtk hook claude` is registered on the `Bash`
matcher. When context-mode wins the race and rewrites `tool_input` to
`ctx_execute(language:"shell", code:"...")`, the tool no longer enters through
the `Bash` matcher — RTK's matcher no longer applies. RTK is bypassed.

The fix is in the checked-out context-mode source at `hooks/pretooluse.mjs`.
When rewriting `Bash`→`ctx_execute`, wrap the inner code with `rtk` if `rtk`
is on `$PATH`:

```js
const wrap = process.env.PATH?.includes("/opt/homebrew/bin") && existsSync("/opt/homebrew/bin/rtk")
  ? (cmd) => `rtk ${cmd}`
  : (cmd) => cmd;
updatedInput.code = wrap(originalCommand);
```

**Ownership compatibility check.** This change does **not** expand RTK's scope — it preserves RTK's shell-filtering ownership when context-mode's rewrite would otherwise hide the command from it. The ownership lanes are unchanged; only the invocation channel changes. This is composition, not lane expansion.

The bigger risk: RTK's filtering inside the sandbox might double-process output that context-mode already indexes. Worth a measurement before committing.

### Claim 3: "Merge the three SessionStart blocks"

**Verdict: WRONG by current repo guidance.**

The repo's lane model does not require collapsing every `SessionStart` block into a single owner. The useful distinction is not *"one block vs many blocks"*; it is *"non-overlapping responsibilities vs overlapping rewrites."* Multiple owners can share an event if each block stays in its own lane.

Trying to consolidate the blocks into a single `wp-sessionstart-routing`
emission would: (1) couple context-mode's content to agent-kit's release
cadence, (2) violate the explicit non-goal *"Hand-maintaining generated
hook/config surfaces as the final solution,"* and (3) require agent-kit to
know context-mode's implementation-specific injection format.

The right framing is **content density per block**, not block count. Each owner should emit a tight, non-redundant block. The current waste isn't *"three blocks fire"* — it's *"each block restates rules the others already cover."* That's a content question for each owner, not a coordination problem.

### Claim 4: "Extract one shared 'noisy commands' classifier"

**Verdict: MISALIGNED with current repo guidance.**

The repo's ownership model is layered, not shared. RTK owns shell filtering. Context-mode owns `ctx_*` routing. Agent-kit owns `wp_*` routing. A shared classifier would couple all three to one config, which:

- Forces RTK's rules to ship through agent-kit (or vice versa), breaking independent release cadence.
- Makes RTK's command-set (38 verbs, [`rtk help`](/opt/homebrew/bin/rtk) output: `ls`, `tree`, `git`, `gh`, `aws`, `psql`, `pnpm`, etc.) discoverable inside agent-kit, which then has to track it. That's the wrong direction of coupling.
- Conflicts with the non-goal *"Expanding RTK beyond the ownership documented in repo/agent-kit guidance."*

The preferred mechanism here is audit-based: **`wp audit hook-surface`** verifies that active hook surfaces *don't overlap unexpectedly* and runs as a CI gate. The audit needs to know the lanes; it does not need a shared classifier.

## State of the art — May 2026 — for this exact stack

Distilled from the verified facts, the current repo guidance, and best-practice search:

1. **Lanes, not chains.** Each runtime extension owns a lane. Composition on shared events is expected; collisions on owner+command identity are drift. ([gstack-routing.md](../../catalog/agent/rules/gstack-routing.md) + `ak-audit-hook-surface-single-rewriter-per-matcher-invariant-ci-gate`).
2. **One rewriter per matcher.** Anthropic's spec makes parallel `updatedInput` non-deterministic. Treat it as a structural invariant: `Bash` has one rewriter (either RTK *or* context-mode, never both simultaneously rewriting).
3. **Audit, don't coordinate.** Verify ownership boundaries in CI via `wp audit hook-surface`. Don't try to coordinate at runtime — the runtime gives you no levers.
4. **Compose at the channel boundary, not the config layer.** When `ctx_execute(shell, code)` masks a command from RTK, fix it inside `ctx_execute`'s code field, not by reordering hooks.
5. **Re-inject on `compact`.** SessionStart blocks vanish after auto-compaction unless the hook matcher includes `compact`. agent-kit already does this; context-mode's `hooks.json` should be checked for the same. (Confirmed by agent-kit's [`sessionstart/index.ts`](../../src/hooks/sessionstart/index.ts) F3 fact-check comment.)
6. **Output cap is 10K chars.** SessionStart `additionalContext` exceeding 10K gets file-spilled. Keep each owner's block under 3K to leave headroom for two more owners without spillover. (Verified from hooks reference.)
7. **`deny` is the strongest contract.** When a guard needs to be unbypassable, return `permissionDecision: "deny"` — it outranks `bypassPermissions` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Don't gate via `permissionDecisionReason` text alone.
8. **Plugin layer doesn't override user layer.** Hooks from all settings layers merge; identical handlers dedupe by command string. This is why a context-mode plugin hook + a user-settings `rtk hook claude` both fire — that's the intended composition, not a bug.

## Concrete recommendations (replaces my prior four)

Ordered by ROI, each aligned to the current repo guidance:

### 1. Land the current audit blueprint

The current draft blueprint is intentionally small (`S`) and directly targets the highest-risk failure mode: overlapping rewriters on the same matcher. Doing that first **is** the answer to *"how do we make them play along better."* My prior suggestions were partly inventing a broader coordination project before landing the narrow CI gate the repo already wants.

### 2. Add the `Bash`-matcher single-rewriter invariant to `wp audit hook-surface`

The current draft blueprint should stay strict about this invariant: **at most one hook with `updatedInput`-capable rewriting per matcher**. This catches the RTK+context-mode `Bash` collision today and prevents future regressions. (Mechanism: parse plugin hook manifests + settings.json; flag if more than one entry in the same matcher returns a non-noop `updatedInput`.)

### 3. Fix RTK invisibility inside `ctx_execute` (one-line patch in your fork)

In the checked-out `context-mode` source's `hooks/pretooluse.mjs`, when
emitting `updatedInput.code` for the shell language, prefix with `rtk ` if
`rtk` is on PATH and the command isn't already an `rtk *` invocation. This
recovers RTK's per-command filtering inside the context-mode sandbox without
expanding RTK's ownership lane.

**Verify cost before committing:** measure raw vs. RTK-wrapped output size on a real `ctx_execute(shell, "git log -100")` — RTK filters first, context-mode indexes the filtered output. If RTK's compression > context-mode's indexing overhead, ship it. If not, skip.

### 4. Skip the SessionStart consolidation

Don't merge blocks. Instead, audit each owner's SessionStart payload for *content-level* redundancy (does ctx-mode's block restate any agent-kit rule? does agent-kit's block re-export any RTK verb?). The fix is dedup-at-the-source, not consolidation-at-the-emitter. This is a 30-min `grep` exercise per owner, not a coordination project.

### 5. Confirm `compact` matcher coverage in context-mode's Codex generator

The next adjacent follow-up after the current audit blueprint is to confirm
`compact`-related coverage in context-mode's Codex scaffolder. Context-mode's
Codex hook generator may be missing `PreCompact`/`PostCompact` coverage that
exists in its Claude Code plugin. Confirm in the installed context-mode Codex
hook bundle's `hooks/codex/*.mjs` files and file the gap upstream.

## Conditions under which this changes

- **Anthropic ships a `priority` field for hooks** → revisit Claim 1; pinning order becomes a one-line fix instead of a structural invariant.
- **context-mode upstream rewrites with `permissionDecision: "deny" + new tool call`** instead of `updatedInput` → race goes away; lanes can both safely rewrite.
- **Webpresso ships its own MCP server** (e.g. for blueprint queries) that needs to be funneled through context-mode's sandbox → the Bash single-rewriter invariant generalizes to "single rewriter per MCP-tool-matcher" and the audit needs the same rule applied broadly.
