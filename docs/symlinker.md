# Symlinker

The symlinker keeps per-IDE command/skill surfaces in sync with a canonical
`.agent/` source of truth. It ships defaults for Claude Code, Cursor,
Windsurf, OpenCode, Codex, Amp, and Gemini CLI, and is designed so new
consumers plug in via configuration.

## Why

Each AI-coding tool has its own file layout for slash-commands and skills.
The good news in 2026: skills are converging. Anthropic open-standardized
`SKILL.md` in December 2025, OpenAI adopted it for Codex, and OpenCode
implemented it with compatibility fallbacks into `.claude/skills/` and
`.agents/skills/`. Practical directory map:

- **Claude Code:** `.claude/commands/*.md`, `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- **Codex CLI:** `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (scanned from CWD up to
  repo root per [OpenAI's "Where to save skills"](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills)).
  Codex's older `.codex/prompts/*.md` custom-prompt surface is deprecated
  and was home-only (`~/.codex/prompts/`) — the symlinker deliberately
  does not target it.
- **OpenCode:** `.opencode/commands/*.md`, `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`,
  with fallback discovery into `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`.
- **Amp (Sourcegraph):** `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- **Cursor:** `.cursor/commands/*.md`. Cursor's skills-analogous surface
  is `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (always-applied rules, different semantics) —
  not a target for webpresso skills.
- **Windsurf:** `.windsurf/commands/*.md`. Same story as Cursor for rules.
- **Gemini CLI:** `.gemini/commands/*.toml` (TOML, not markdown — with
  `{{args}}` templating instead of `$ARGUMENTS`).

Because Codex + Amp + OpenCode-fallback all converge on `.agents/skills/`,
the symlinker ships **two skill surfaces that cover four tools**:
`.claude/skills` (directory-symlink for Claude + OpenCode-fallback) and
`.agents/skills/<name>` (per-skill symlinks for Codex + Amp +
OpenCode-fallback). No per-tool `.codex/skills/` or `.opencode/skills/`
entries are needed.

Without a sync layer, contributors hand-maintain N copies of every
command. The symlinker makes `.agent/` the one place to edit, and keeps
the consumer-specific surfaces derived.

## How

### Per-file command/workflow symlinks

For each markdown file at `.agent/commands/<name>.md` or
`.agent/workflows/<name>.md`, the symlinker creates a **relative filesystem
symlink** at each consumer's command directory pointing back at the
`.agent/` source. Example: `.claude/commands/<name>.md` →
`../../.agent/commands/<name>.md`. Same pattern for `.cursor/commands/`,
`.windsurf/commands/`, and `.opencode/commands/`.

### Skill symlinks — two modes

Skills under `.agent/skills/<name>/` are published in one of two modes,
picked per consumer:

**Directory mode** — one symlink at `.claude/skills` pointing at the whole
`../.agent/skills` directory. Cheapest, but assumes the consumer owns the
entire skills directory (no coexistence with third-party skills). This
single symlink also serves OpenCode, which reads `.claude/skills/` as a
project-local fallback.

**Per-skill mode** — one symlink per skill, e.g. `.agents/skills/<name>`
→ `../../.agent/skills/<name>`. Used for the convergent `.agents/skills/`
directory that Codex + Amp + OpenCode-fallback all read, because that
directory may already contain third-party or consumer-owned skills;
per-skill mode creates links only for names that exist in
`.agent/skills/`, leaving consumer-owned directories alone. If a
consumer-owned directory collides with an webpresso skill name, the
symlinker warns and skips rather than clobbering it.

Editors on macOS and Linux follow symlinks natively. Windows requires
Developer Mode or admin privileges for `CreateSymbolicLink`; consumers on
Windows who run into this should run from a shell with symlink privileges or
use `wp sync --check` in CI to detect drift before committing.

### TOML consumer (`.gemini`)

Gemini CLI doesn't follow symlinks reliably and wants TOML with
double-brace `{{args}}` templating. For each `.agent/commands/<name>.md`,
the symlinker:

1. Parses the markdown's YAML frontmatter + body.
2. Writes `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml` with:
   ```toml
   description = "<frontmatter.description>"
   prompt = """
   <markdown body, with $ARGUMENTS → {{args}} substituted>
   """
   ```
3. Deletes `.gemini/commands/*.toml` whose source `.md` no longer exists
   (stale-artifact cleanup).

## Commands

### `wp sync`

Writes symlinks and regenerates TOML. Idempotent — safe to run
repeatedly. Reports:

```
🔗 Syncing agent command/workflow symlinks...
   Found 17 source files in .agent/
  ✅ verify.md → ../../.agent/commands/verify.md
  ✅ tph.md → ../../.agent/commands/tph.md
  ...
  ✅ All agent command/workflow/skill symlinks are properly configured
```

### `wp sync --check`

Same work as `sync`, but **exits non-zero** if anything was out of sync.
Use in pre-commit / CI to fail loudly on drift:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
vp exec wp sync --check
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Agent surface sync check
  run: vp exec wp sync --check
```

If the check fails, run `wp sync` locally and commit the output.

## Consumers & their defaults

Defined in `src/symlinker/consumers.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_CONSUMERS: ConsumerConfig[] = [
  { dir: '.claude/commands',   sourcePrefix: '../../.agent/' },
  { dir: '.cursor/commands',   sourcePrefix: '../../.agent/' },
  { dir: '.windsurf/commands', sourcePrefix: '../../.agent/' },
  { dir: '.opencode/commands', sourcePrefix: '../../.agent/' },
]

// Directory-mode: one whole-directory symlink per consumer.
// Serves Claude Code + OpenCode-fallback discovery.
export const DEFAULT_SKILLS_CONSUMERS: SkillsConsumerConfig[] = [
  { linkPath: '.claude/skills', target: '../.agent/skills' },
]

// Per-skill mode: one symlink per file under each skill. `.agents/skills/`
// is the convergent project path shared by Codex (official), Amp (official),
// and OpenCode (fallback) — one entry covers three tools. Source-of-truth
// is `.agent/skills/<slug>/` (the consumer projection produced by
// `runUnifiedSync` + scaffolders), not `node_modules/...`.
export const DEFAULT_PER_SKILL_CONSUMERS: PerSkillConsumerConfig[] = [
  { dir: '.agents/skills' },
]
```

To add a new consumer (e.g., a future CLI tool), either:

- Send a PR to webpresso adding an entry to `DEFAULT_CONSUMERS`,
  `DEFAULT_SKILLS_CONSUMERS`, or `DEFAULT_PER_SKILL_CONSUMERS` (pick the
  mode that matches the tool's skill-directory semantics) so all repos
  pick it up.
- Or override in your `.webpressorc.json` for a repo-local customization
  (planned).

`.gemini/commands/` is **not** in `DEFAULT_CONSUMERS` because it's a
TOML-transform consumer (handled by `syncGeminiCommands`), not a
symlink consumer.

## What counts as "out of sync"

The symlinker flags drift when:

- A `.agent/commands/<x>.md` exists but `.claude/commands/<x>.md` does not
  (missing symlink).
- `.claude/commands/<x>.md` exists and is a regular file (not a symlink) —
  the symlinker removes it and re-links. **Warning:** if you've manually
  edited the file thinking you were editing the source, those edits get
  lost. `wp sync --check` catches this before it happens.
- `.claude/commands/<x>.md` exists as a symlink pointing at the wrong
  target (e.g., after restructuring `.agent/`).
- `.claude/commands/<x>.md` exists but no corresponding `.agent/` source
  does (stale symlink after deleting a command).

`.gemini/commands/<x>.toml` drift: TOML contents differ from what
transformation of the current `.md` would produce.

## `ALLOWED_REAL_FILES`

Some consumer directories are allowed to hold real (non-symlink) files
alongside agent-sourced symlinks — typically `.markdownlint.json` in
`.claude/commands/` to quiet lint on the generated files. These paths
are listed in `ALLOWED_REAL_FILES` in `consumers.ts`; the symlinker
leaves them alone.

## What to track vs ignore under `.claude/`

- **Track** deliberate repo-owned surfaces like committed `.claude/commands/*.md`
  symlinks (when a repo uses them) and any explicitly documented real files
  allowed alongside them.
- **Ignore** generated/runtime-only subpaths such as `.claude/rules/`,
  `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/worktrees/`, and local scheduler/runtime state.
- Avoid blanket `.claude/` ignores in shared defaults unless the repo
  intentionally wants the entire directory local-only; blanket ignores can hide
  deliberate committed instruction surfaces.

## Library API

For programmatic use (e.g., custom tooling, tests):

```typescript
import {
  syncAll,
  syncConsumer,
  syncSkills,
  syncSkillsConsumer,
  syncSkillFanout,
  syncSkillFanouts,
  syncGeminiCommands,
  isAgentOrConsumerFile,
  type ConsumerConfig,
  type SkillsConsumerConfig,
  type PerSkillConsumerConfig,
  type SyncSkillFanoutResult,
  DEFAULT_CONSUMERS,
  DEFAULT_SKILLS_CONSUMERS,
  DEFAULT_PER_SKILL_CONSUMERS,
} from 'webpresso/symlinker'

const fixes = syncAll(repoRoot)
if (fixes > 0) console.log(`Fixed ${fixes} symlinks`)

// Per-skill fanout returns a structured result (replaces the legacy bare-number
// `syncPerSkillConsumer`/`syncPerSkillConsumers` API; renamed to fix the
// dangling-symlink class — see CHANGELOG entry "Eliminate the dangling-symlink
// class in .agents/skills/").
const result: SyncSkillFanoutResult = syncSkillFanouts(repoRoot)
console.log(`syncSkillFanouts: wrote ${result.wrote} entries`)
```

## Limitations

- **Windows filesystem symlinks** require elevated permissions. A future
  `--copy` mode would write regular files instead of symlinks; drift
  detection would rely on content diffs. Not yet implemented.
- **Gemini CLI `{{args}}` templating** is the only supported
  transformation. Other runtimes with non-markdown formats need their
  own converter alongside the TOML writer.
- **`.gitignore` interactions.** Symlinks must be committed to git to
  reach CI and other contributors. Don't add `.claude/commands/` to
  `.gitignore` — commit it.
