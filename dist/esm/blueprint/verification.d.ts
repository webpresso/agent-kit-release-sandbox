/**
 * Verification block markdown helper.
 *
 * Owns three responsibilities, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Validate** caller-supplied evidence against the Evidence Contract
 *    (see `./evidence.ts`). Trivial payloads, empty lists, and any evidence
 *    item with `result === 'fail'` reject the transition without touching
 *    markdown.
 * 2. **Serialize** the canonicalized evidence into a stable markdown block
 *    rooted under a fixed canonical header (`VERIFICATION_BLOCK_HEADER`).
 *    The stable header is the anti-forgery anchor: future re-ingests can
 *    detect tampering by re-canonicalizing and comparing.
 * 3. **Edit** the blueprint `_overview.md` in-place (read → edit → write)
 *    atomically and then trigger a re-ingest of the projection DB.
 *
 * This module is consumed by `wp_blueprint_task_verify` (Task 3.2). It does
 * not register MCP tools and has no transitive MCP dependency.
