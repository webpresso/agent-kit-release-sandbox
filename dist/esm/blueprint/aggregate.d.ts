/**
 * Read-only aggregate helpers across selected blueprint projects (Task 3.1).
 *
 * Fans out read-only queries to N project projection DBs (resolved by Task 1.2's
 * `resolveBlueprintProjects`), checks freshness (Task 1.3 — `checkFreshness`),
 * tags every row with its source `project_id`, and merges results in memory.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * - **No global projection DB.** Each project owns a worktree-scoped SQLite
 *   file resolved by Task 1.1's `resolveBlueprintProjectionDbPath`. This helper
 *   opens those DBs one at a time and unions the rows in JS — no schema
 *   change, no parallel projection.
 *
 * - **Failure isolation.** A broken/missing/stale DB for one project records a
 *   structured failure entry and continues. The aggregate call never throws
 *   for per-project errors — callers see `ok: true` with `failures` populated.
 *
 * - **Stale projection → `next_action: 'reingest_project'`** (F11/R9). The
 *   offending `project_id` is included in the failure entry; the caller can
 *   re-ingest that one project without disturbing the others.
 *
 * - **Duplicate slugs.** When two projects expose the same blueprint slug,
 *   both rows appear in `rows` (tagged by `project_id`) and the slug is also
 *   listed under `duplicate_slugs`. Callers MUST disambiguate; this helper
 *   refuses to silently pick one.
 *
 * - **F15 — read-only target shape.** `ReadTarget = { project_id?, scope? }`.
 *   It does NOT extend the `MutationTarget` zod base. Including a mutation
 *   field (`worktree_path`, etc.) at parse time is a type error. Mutation
 *   tools must not share this shape.

 * Behaviour summary (acceptance reference):
 *
 *  - **Tagged rows:** every row in `rows` carries `project_id` of the source
 *    project. The reader callback never sees this field.
 *  - **Failure isolation:** a broken DB, a stale projection, or a reader
 *    exception records a `failures[]` entry and the aggregate call still
 *    returns `ok`. Other projects continue.
 *  - **Stale projection:** returns `next_action: 'reingest_project'` with the
 *    offending `project_id` in `failures[]`. Does NOT throw.
 *  - **Scope:** `'current' | 'roots' | 'workspace' | 'all'` selects which
 *    resolved projects to fan out across. `'current'` is the default when
 *    neither `scope` nor `project_id` is provided.
 *  - **Duplicate slugs:** rows with a string `slug` field are checked; any
 *    slug appearing in more than one project is surfaced in
 *    `duplicate_slugs[]`. Callers MUST refuse to silently pick one.
 *  - **Read-only:** the input schema (`readTargetSchema`) has no mutation
 *    fields; `.strict()` rejects extras at zod parse time.
 *
 * The reader is given an already-open DB and is expected to issue ordinary
 * read queries (e.g. the existing query templates under `src/blueprint/db/`).
 * Connection lifecycle is owned by the aggregate helper.
