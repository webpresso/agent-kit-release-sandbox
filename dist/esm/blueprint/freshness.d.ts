/**
 * HEAD-pinned projection freshness (F11 / E11 / R9).
 *
 * The blueprint markdown directory is git-tracked. A `git checkout other-branch`
 * flips on-disk files without touching the SQLite projection, so cached MCP
 * reads can silently return rows for the wrong commit. This module pins HEAD
 * at ingest time and refuses cached reads when HEAD has moved.
 *
 * Storage: a JSON sidecar at `<dbPath>.meta.json`. The sidecar is intentionally
 * decoupled from the SQLite schema so this task does not touch migrations or
 * collide with Task 1.1's path policy. The sidecar is rebuilt by the ingester
 * and may be safely deleted — `checkFreshness` will return
 * `next_action: 'reingest_project'`.
 *
 * Non-goals here:
 *   - No long-lived cache. Each call re-reads the sidecar and re-runs
 *     `git rev-parse HEAD`.
 *   - No watcher / no background invalidation.
 *   - No platform-canonical sync.
 *
 * Consumers: `assembleBlueprintContext` (this task) and Task 2.2's MCP
 * handlers (`wp_blueprint_list`, `_get`, `_context`).
