/**
 * BlueprintSyncClient — webpresso HTTP client for the webpresso platform API.
 *
 * Implements `BlueprintPlatformClient` (types.ts) using the Fetch API.
 *
 * Design:
 *  - WP_BLUEPRINT_PLATFORM_DISABLED=1: every method is a no-op / empty result.
 *  - Token from SyncCredentials (loaded via loadSyncCredentials() in auth.ts).
 *  - Idempotency: auto-generates a UUID eventId when payload.eventId is empty.
 *  - Retry: max 3 attempts on 5xx / network errors, exponential backoff.
 *  - 401: throws AuthError immediately — no retry (token invalid, re-auth needed).
 *  - 409: treated as success (idempotent duplicate, platform silently ignores).
 *  - 429: retried with backoff, counts toward the 3-attempt limit.
 *  - listTemplates: reads from WP_BLUEPRINT_TEMPLATES_URL; returns [] on error.
 *  - Structured log on every pushEvent call.
