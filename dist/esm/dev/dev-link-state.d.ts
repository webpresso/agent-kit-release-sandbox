 * Read + validate the dev-link state file from a consumer's repo root.
 *
 * Returns `null` when:
 *   - the file is absent (CI / never linked) — silent no-op path
 *   - the file is malformed JSON — degrade gracefully, never crash callers
 *   - required fields (`package`, `linkedFrom`) are missing or wrong type
 *
 * Callers MUST treat `null` as "no dev-link active" and proceed silently.
 * Callers that need fail-loud semantics on degraded state (e.g. the postinstall
 * restore bin) should layer their own error handling on top.
