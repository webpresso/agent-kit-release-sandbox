/**
 * Blueprint mutation verbs — advanceTask, promoteBlueprint, finalizeBlueprint
 *
 * All mutations:
 *   1. Edit the canonical _overview.md on disk (atomic tmp+rename)
 *   2. Re-ingest into the structured-store DB via ingestAll
 *
 * Platform-first sync (Tasks 2.6 + 2.7):
 *   When a SyncAdapter is available (credentials present, not disabled), mutations
 *   push a BlueprintPlatformEvent before updating local markdown/SQLite.
 *   Iron rule: WP_BLUEPRINT_PLATFORM_DISABLED=1 skips the adapter entirely — the
 *   markdown-canonical path runs byte-identically to the pre-migration behaviour.
