/**
 * Contract-safe `webpresso/launch` public surface.
 *
 * This package defines generic, host-agnostic launch primitives. Host
 * adapters (e.g. the Neon-backed provisioner in `@webpresso/cli-utils`)
 * consume these contracts; launch-engine itself has no dependency on any
 * host-specific package and uses no Webpresso app-slug literals.
