/**
 * Unified rule + skill sync.
 *
 * Source of truth: catalog (`<pkg>/dist/catalog/agent/{rules,skills}/`) UNION
 * consumer (`<repo>/agent-{rules,skills}/`). The loader returns a
 * source-tagged record list; this module projects that list into per-IDE
 * surfaces according to `DEFAULT_UNIFIED_CONSUMERS`.
 *
 * Per-consumer strategy:
 *   - 'symlink':   relative symlink (file for rules, dir for skills).
 *   - 'copy':      atomic copy (file for rules, recursive copy for skills).
 *   - 'transform': apply the consumer's transform function to the record body
 *                  and atomic-write the result at the target path.
 *
 * Prune: any file/dir under a consumer's dir whose name matches the unified
 * filename pattern but is not in the expected set is removed. This propagates
 * deletions in `agent-rules/` and `agent-skills/` to per-IDE cleanup.
 *
 * `--check` mode (dry-run): produce a list of (target, status) pairs and
 * return the count of mismatches; perform no writes.
