 *
 * The historical failure mode was `console.log('✅')` followed by a symlink
 * whose target doesn't exist — `lstatSync` succeeds (symlink exists), but
 * the file the symlink points to doesn't. Use this helper instead of
 * `expect(stat.isSymbolicLink()).toBe(true)` so dangling links fail tests.
