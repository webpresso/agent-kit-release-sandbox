/**
 * Centralized blueprint projection-DB path policy.
 *
 * Single source of truth for where the SQLite projection of blueprint markdown
 * lives, plus the two lock files that gate writes to that projection and to
 * the underlying markdown directory.
 *
 * ## Lock-scope decision (F9 / R7, Task 1.1)
 *
 * We adopt the **two-lock** policy:
 *
 * 1. **Projection DB lock — `'worktree'` scope.**
 *    The SQLite file at `getSurfacePath('blueprints/blueprints.db', 'worktree', cwd)`
 *    is a per-worktree derived artifact. Concurrent writers in the **same**
 *    worktree (cold-start + mutation re-ingest, two ingest paths, etc.) must
 *    serialize against the projection. Cross-worktree writers target distinct
 *    DB files, so they do not need this lock.
 *
 * 2. **Markdown-mutation lock — `'repo'` scope.**
 *    The `blueprints/` markdown directory is git-tracked and shared across
 *    all worktrees of the same repository. Cross-worktree concurrent writers
 *    that mutate markdown (`advanceTask`, `promoteBlueprint`, `finalizeBlueprint`)
 *    must serialize against each other. This lock guards the directory, not
 *    the DB.
 *
 * ## Silent advisory escape removed
 *
 * The legacy `acquireLock` helper in `cold-start.ts` waited up to 5 s and then
 * "proceeded anyway" if it could not acquire. That escape is removed on write
 * paths — write callers must use the typed lock helpers in this module, which
 * raise `LockTimeoutError` on failure. Read-only paths may proceed without a
 * lock (they take a consistent SQLite snapshot regardless).
 *
 * ## Legacy fallback
 *
 * Non-git temp repos (most tests, ad-hoc directories) cannot resolve a repo
 * key. For those we keep the historical `<cwd>/.agent/.blueprints.db` layout
 * so existing fixtures and bootstrap flows continue to work.
 *
 * For git repos that still carry a stray `.agent/.blueprints.db` from a
 * previous webpresso version, see `legacy-migration.ts`.
