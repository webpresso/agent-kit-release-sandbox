This directory is the canonical home for implementation plans (blueprints).
Each subdirectory represents a lifecycle state:

- \`draft/\` — early-stage sketches. Expect churn; move to \`planned/\` once scoped.
- \`planned/\` — committed-to specs, ready to pick up.
- \`in-progress/\` — actively being executed. Exactly one blueprint per lane.
- \`completed/\` — execution finished and verified. Kept for reference.
- \`parked/\` — intentionally paused. Include a reason in the spec's frontmatter.
- \`archived/\` — superseded or abandoned. Not deleted — the record matters.

## Authoring

- Use \`docs/templates/blueprint.md\` as the starting point.
- Blueprint YAML keys validated against \`docs/templates/blueprint.yaml\`.
- For iterative refinement, load the \`plan-refine\` skill
  (\`.agent/skills/plan-refine/SKILL.md\`).

## Moving between states

- \`draft → planned\`: the spec passes the plan-audit checklist
  (\`.agent/guides/plan-audit-checklist.md\`).
- \`planned → in-progress\`: work has started in a worktree or a lane.
- \`in-progress → completed\`: all acceptance criteria verified.
- Any state → \`archived\`: when the work is dropped or replaced.

Move files with \`git mv\` so history follows the spec through its lifecycle.
